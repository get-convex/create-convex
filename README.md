# create-convex

## Scaffolding Your First Convex Project

```bash
$ npm create convex@latest
```

Then follow the prompts!

You can also directly specify the project name and the template you want to use
via additional command line options. For example, to scaffold a Convex project
with no client, run:

```bash
npm create convex@latest my-app -- --template none-none
```

Currently supported template presets include:

- `none-none`

You can use `.` for the project name to scaffold in the current directory.
